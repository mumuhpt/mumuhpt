⚡ Currently I work with QTA (Automatic Transfer Switch) assembly for generator sets

## 🚀 Philosophy

"Persistence and determination are very powerful, Show that you can't be defeated by anything, 
that you have inner peace, incredible health, and consistently strong energy.
If you strive to live these things every day, the results will be obvious to you.
As much as it may seem like a fantasy, it's up to you to create your own future.
